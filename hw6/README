CS 241, Assignment 6 - Huffman Coding
----------------------------------------------------------
This assignment handin includes these files:

-Makefile
-README - this file
-encode.c - program to encode a file using Huffman compression
-decode.c - program to decode Huffman compressed file
-'-v' - a file that you can't remove (and neither can I)


- Unresolved warnings that are generated by valgrind.
I'm getting warnings about using uninitialized values even after having initialized them. It seems these values (a global array of char*'s called codes[]) being global have something to do with that. I'm calling free() on every pointer that I malloced to, but for some reason the free() calls are not working.

- Estimate of the amount of space that can be saved by this algorithm were it to use bits instead of bytes:
~80%, because we're currently using approximately a little less than 8-bits for every bit of information in the huffman compressed output.



----------------------------------------------------------
I agree that I have adhered to the honor code in this assignment and have had a blast doing so.
(and worked individually)
