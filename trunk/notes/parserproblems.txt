1. empty statements, i.e. ; dont work // fixed
2. empty compound statements, {} dont work //fixed
3. params with *s in them dont work properly. void * and int * seem to be the suspects. // fixed
4. multiple compound statemets dont go through the parser well.
   eg.
int f(){
    {
        ;	
    }    
    {
       ;
    }
}
FALSE ANALYSIS! multiple compound stataments work perfectly, 
but statements like j=1.2 don't work, i.e float number assignments 
5. a =1.2 doesn't work. a=1 does.
