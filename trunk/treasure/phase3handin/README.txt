acc.java is the main file of the program (i.e. contains the main method).
"acc" stands for "Akshat and Chris Compiler".
Syntax:
java acc testfile.c

Please note: "compiler error" - all errors that we think the user should never ever get, and 
errors that occurred because of bad coding on our parts are marked as compiler 
errors so that the  hypothetical customer/user can call us and tell us that they found a "bug".
