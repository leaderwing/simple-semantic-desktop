CSCI 364 Artificial Intelligence 
The Doctor Is In
Spring 2007
--------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eliza, originally written by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT, is an "Artifically 
Intelligent" dialog program that pretends to be 'The doctor'.

To compile Eliza type:
	javac eliza.java 
To run Eliza type:
	java eliza

To exit Eliza, enter a resposne with the word 'bye' in it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extra: I built Eliza using a HashMap and an array of Strings for the keywords,
so that it can be easily extended to recognize more keywords and give more 
responses.

I agree that I have adhered to the honor code in this assignment
